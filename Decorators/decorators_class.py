''' Decorating functions with classes: a decorator does not have to be a function.
In Python, it could be a class that plays the role of a decorator as a function.
classes bring all the subsidiarity they can offer, like inheritance and the ability
 to create dedicated supportive methods.'''

# Class decorators (docrating classes)
''' Like function decorators, the new (decorated) class is available under the name 
'MyClass' and is used to create an instance. The original class named 'MyClass' is no
longer available in your name space. The callable object returned by the class decorator
creates and returns a new instance of the original class, extended in some way.'''

''' Decorators allow us to wrap another callable object in order to extend its behavior.
Decorators rely heavily on closures and *args and **kwargs.
The idea of decorators was described in two documents â€“ PEP 318 and PEP 3129. Don't be
discouraged that the first PEP was prepared for Python 2, because what matters here is
the idea, not the implementation in a specific Python.'''
