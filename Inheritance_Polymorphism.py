''' 2.2.1.8/9 Inheritance and polymorphism â€” two pillars of OOP combined '''

class Device:
    def turn_on(self):
        print('The device was turned on')
# Inheritance: class Radio inherits the turn_on() method from its superclass
class Radio(Device):
    pass

# polymorphism: all class instances allow the calling of the turn_on() method,
#  even when you refer to the objects using the arbitrary variable element
class PortableRadio(Device):
    def turn_on(self):
        print('PortableRadio type object was turned on')

print()
class Wax:
    def melt(self):
        print("Wax can be used to form a tool")

class Cheese:
    def melt(self):

class Wood:
    def fire(self):
        print("A fire has been started!")

for element in Wax(), Cheese(), Wood():

''' polymorphism is used when different class objects share conceptually similar
 methods (but are not always inherited)
polymorphism leverages clarity and expressiveness of the application design 
and development;
when polymorphism is assumed, it is wise to handle exceptions that could pop
 up.'''
